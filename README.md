# BELP! - A Yelp ... for books!
### BELP! is currently a bookmark app in which visitors can turn into devoted book readers with their own account by logging in with google's OAuth authentication.
### A logged-in user can add books to their library, add a bookmark to keep track of their progress, and update their bookmarks.
### Both visitors and logged-in users can view a global library in where the books that each user is currently reading are displayed.

## Next Steps:
* I want to better the user experiences by adding more add-able entries when adding a book (genre, author, year published, picture of their book)
* Create a type of visually appealing card for each logged-in user when on they're on the global page or their own library.
* The card will hold user information and their list of books
* Create search functionality to be able to find a book or profile 
* Fix positioning of website on smaller screens
* Add the ability to add a book entry that someone entered and also like/comment on someone else's review of the book (review will be visible on global scope)
